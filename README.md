This is a project made after gettiing classes from IBM and our On the job traiining done in our class. This is a News Aggregator named Pulse made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Use of bootstrap also is done . This is a combined project with my classmates.
In this project, I built the complete frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML was used to structure the layout, including the navigation bar, search input, category buttons, and news sections. CSS was used to design a modern, responsive user interface with custom colors, layouts, and typography. JavaScript handles fetching live news data from the GNews API, managing category-based filtering, search functionality, and dynamically rendering news articles on the page.
